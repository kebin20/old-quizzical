# quizzical

A quiz app that pulls quiz data from the Open Trivia Database. 

TODO: 

- Display the number of correct answers once the answers have been checked (after pressing the "check answers" button)

- Restart the game after clicking the "Play Again" button and bring user back to the welcome screen (COMPLETED)

FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION: 

- Need to know how to implement a loading screen when the API is being fetched

- Move business logic out from QuizList into the App.jsx
